### Usage

```python
python edic2epwing.py path_to_csv_dir
```

And then, build generated HTML files into EPWING dictionary with `EDIC2-1.ebx`, `EDIC2-2.ebx`, and `EDIC2-3.ebx`. 


Note1: Before using this script, you need to convert E-DIC2 dictionaries to csv files with `edic2conv`. See [rubyu / edic2conv â€” Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/rubyu/edic2conv) for more information.

Note2: `EDIC2-3.ebx` needs newly updated dictionaries by online, if you want to build this, you should register and apply online updates.

Note3: To build ebx files, `ebstudio2` is needed. 

### Requirements

- Python >= 3.6
